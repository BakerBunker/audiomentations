# `Gain`

_Added in v0.11.0_

Multiply the audio by a random amplitude factor to reduce or increase the volume. This
technique can help a model become somewhat invariant to the overall gain of the input audio.

Warning: This transform can return samples outside the [-1, 1] range, which may lead to
clipping or wrap distortion, depending on what you do with the audio in a later stage.
